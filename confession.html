                    Hello Cyrel,<br><br>

                    I hope you are doing well right now while reading this letter. I am writing this letter to tell you what I feel formally.<br><br>

                    Before, I found myself thinking about you more often than I probably should have. It was confusing because I knew we were just friends, and suddenly developing feelings seemed odd given our limited interaction, right? So, I denied my feelings and convinced myself I didn't like you. However, over time, I came to accept that I had a small crush on you—nothing wrong with that, right? I thought it would remain that way. But as time went on, I found myself mentioning you more often to my mom. Still, I brushed off my feelings, believing there was no chance, so I kept them to myself. Then, one day, I came across a strawberry Mogu-Mogu drink, and you crossed my mind out of nowhere. It made me realize my feelings were deeper than just a simple crush. I told my mom, who also noticed changes in me whenever I talked about you. She saw how my face lit up when you were the topic, and she noticed my excitement.<br><br>

                    I admire your kindness, intelligence, and unwavering dedication never fails to impress me. Your presence exudes positivity, effortlessly brightening even the dullest moments. It may sound cliché, but I genuinely see you as my ray of sunshine because I enjoy every moment we spend together. Your genuine warmth and positive outlook make every interaction memorable.<br><br>

                    I used to be so selfless, giving others whatever they wanted from me. This time, I will be selfish— I want you to be mine. I want to share my vulnerable self with you<br><br>

                    You know those moments in life that feel like they're straight out of a movie? Well, every time I'm with you, it's like experiencing one of those magical scenes. Your laughter feels like music, your smile lights up the room, and your presence is like a gentle breeze on a warm day – it's simply enchanting.<br><br>

                    Every time I think about you, it's like discovering a new melody that I can't get out of my head.
